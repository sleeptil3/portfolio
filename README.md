# Shawn Clary
## A puzzle-loving, creative full-stack developer

Welcome to the respository for my portfolio code. If you're curious about the technologies, check out the code. The featured external libraries I used were Aos (Animate On Scroll) for animation, React-Scroll for the anchor link smooth scrolling, and TailwindCSS for all the styling.

If you want to check out my Figma board where I pre-vis'd the whole thing, you can check that out [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1UGe5CeOwg0zM2Qce9uuuy/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1).
